# Assignment 1

I liked the website [Experiments With Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/search?q=WebGL), specifically this [WebGL Path Tracing](https://madebyevan.com/webgl-path-tracing/) algorithm that Evan Wallace made.
The ability to move around objects in real-time, including mirrored objects and the light source, showcases the complexity of the algorithm. Although I don't fully understand the math behind it, I can appreciate its complexity.
