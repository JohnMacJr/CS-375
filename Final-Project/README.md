# Final Project: Ship over Scrolling Landscape

## **Project Overview**

I intend to create an interactive graphics application in which a spaceship flies over a repeating vertically scrolling landscape. 
The ship will automatically move forward, and the player can control the tilt to move it. I will use models and textures I can find or make, and a "gods eye" view of the ship over the terrain.
I'll use lighting to try and show the elevation of the ship, and if possible I will try to use normal maps for terrain generation.
