# Final Project: Ship over Scrolling Landscape

## **Project Overview**

I intend to create an interactive graphics application in which a spaceship flies over a repeating vertically scrolling landscape. 
The ship will automatically move forward, and the player can control the tilt to move it. I will use models and textures I can find or make, and a "gods eye" view of the ship over the terrain.
I'll use lighting to try and show the ship's elevation, and if possible I will try to use normal maps for terrain generation.

## **Project Schedule**

- Week 1 - Look at similar projects for inspiration, search for or create models, and access what I can realistically create.
- Week 2 - Load ship model, create a basic landscape with textures.
- Week 3 - Add animations, ship rolling and landscape scrolling, set up lighting, maybe add additional models to terrain.
- Week 4 - Crunch and polish project work on presentation. Attempt to add anything cosmetic or additional for fun.

## **Project Technical Requirements**
I intend to use Three.js and JavaScript
